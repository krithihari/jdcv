          We are teenage twins who are enthusiastic about science and math (yes, there are two of us)! As of the school year of 2018-2019 we are Juniors in High School! We both love coding during our free time and had a lot of fun writing this book
          to teach kids how to code! As of when we published this book, we are two-time winners of the U.S. Congressional App Challenge for our district! We would love for more kids to learn how to code and be excited about science, technology,
          engineering, and mathematics!
